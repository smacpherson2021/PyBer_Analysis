# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 

This analysis looks at ride-sharing data by city type. A summary DataFrame is created of the ride-sharing data by city type and then using Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type is created. Finally this report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results:

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
