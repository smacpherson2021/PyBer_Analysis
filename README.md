# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 

This analysis looks at ride-sharing data by city type. A summary DataFrame is created of the ride-sharing data by city type and then using Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type is created. Finally this report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results:

The following images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, will describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

***Ride-sharing data by city type summary:*** <br />
- Total Urban fares $39,854.38 are about twice as large as Suburban fares $19,356.33	 and 9 times as large as rural fares $4,327.93. 
- Highest average fare per ride are in Rural cities at $34.62/ride making drivers the most per average fare $55.49/driver.
- Lowest average fare per ride are in Urban cities at $24.53/ride making drivers the least per average fare $16.57/driver.

***Total Weekly Fare by City Type:***
- Urban weekly fares are the highest and generally range between $2,000-$2,500/week
- Suburban weekly fares generally range between $750-$1,250/week
- Rural weekly fares are the lowest and generally range less than $500/week
- Overall weekly fares tend to be fairly consitant week over week for the period between January to April 2019

***Ride-sharing data bubble chart:***
- The majority of rides are in Urban cities with more drivers but, with lower average fares

***City Type Percentages by total fares, total rides, and total drivers:***
- Urban cities make up the majority for all three values, followed by suburban cities and then rural cities make up the least.

## Summary:

Recommendations based on the results, to address disparities among the city types:
- Try to increase the number of drivers in rural cities. Assuming that there is an under serviced demand for rides in rural areas, an increase in drivers would allow the company to increase total fares. The average fare per ride in rural areas is highest amoung the three city types and generating more rides in these cities would greatly increase total fares. Data is needed to confirm the assumption that an increase in drivers would result in more fares in Rural areas. 
- Incentivize drivers to work in Rural areas by paying them more then in Urban or Suburban areas. Since the average fare per ride in Rural cities is about $10/ride more then in Uban cities some of this extra money could be used to pay Rural drivers more which would attract more drivers to work in Rural areas. Data is needed to confirm why there are less drivers in rural areas. 
- Try to increase the cost per fare in Urban cities to increase the average fare per ride. It is assumed the average fare per ride in Urban cities is lower becuase the distance traveled is generally lower then it would be in rural areas. Increasing the cost per fare would help boost the ubran average fare per ride to that of the other areas making it more equitable. Data is needed to confirm the effect of price increases on demand. 

provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
